I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Paul Scherrer Institute, where I investigate the fascinating world of computational condensed matter physics. 
My day-to-day work involves simulating novel materials and developing tool for tackling quantum-scale challenges using Rust, Julia, and Python. 
I’m also exploring new frontiers in web development, currently diving into HTMX to enhance my projects. 
Welcome to my blog, a space where I capture and share my ideas, research insights, and ongoing adventures in coding.
